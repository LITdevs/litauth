    <li>Session ID, stored on your computer via cookies;</li>
    <li>OAuth applications created by you;</li>

<h3>Third-party services</h3>
We use Cloudflare to protect our service from attacks, so you are subject to their <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">privacy policy</a> as well. You are a "End User" in that document.<br>
We do not store any cookies other than Session IDs, and we do not embed tracking or analytics code in the Service.<br><br>

<h2>How we use your data</h2>
Your Account ID, Session ID, and username is used to identify you. Your Account ID may be logged to us if it is detected that your account is bypassing restrictions set by us.<br>
Your e-mail is used to identify you in support requests and send you important notifications.<br>
We monitor OAuth applications created by you, to ensure that they are not used for malicious purposes.<br>
Your data may be shared with a third-party application, if you consent to that via the OAuth prompt, which informs you what data is shared if you accept.<br><br>

Everything we collect is stored on our servers and is only used for service operation.<br>
We do not have advertising partners, and we do not give your data to any third parties without your consent.
